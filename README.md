🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
I was able to successfully create a navigation bar and position it where I wanted using Flexbox. The navigation looks well organised, responsive, and easy to use. I also ensured that all background images and media content load correctly across the page, and I was able to style my call-to-action sections to create a clear, user-friendly layout.


🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
At the beginning, I struggled to get several features working, especially my background music, button interactions, and positioning my call-to-action boxes on top of the images. Some of my media files were not loading at first, and my layout was not displaying the way I expected.
 However, I was able to troubleshoot these issues using online resources such as Google and with guidance during development, and I managed to resolve the problems.

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

I found it difficult to understand why things were breaking when they looked “right” in my code. For example, my audio would not play because my file paths were incorrect and my folders were not structured properly. My buttons also stopped working at one point due to duplicated elements and misplaced tags, which took time to identify.

Positioning my CTA boxes on top of background images was also challenging, as I had to learn how position: relative and position: absolute work together. I also found Flexbox difficult at first, especially when aligning my navigation items correctly.

These challenges were frustrating, but they helped me understand debugging, file organisation, and layout control much better. 

I think one thing i need to improve on is simplyfying my CSS. However, as this works, I'm worried something will break as a result, it is something that i need to be confident in.
